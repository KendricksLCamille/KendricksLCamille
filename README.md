**Senior Software Engineer**

Driven by a passion for solving business problems, I have developed a deep expertise across all aspects of the software development life cycle. My experience spans project management, lead development, and supporting roles on both professional and personal projects. I am a self-learner who thrives on continuous improvement, quickly adapting to new technologies and development paradigms. My current focus is on C# and XServer, with aspirations to expand into Godot and Redot in the future.

**Leadership Approach**

As a team leader, I employ a hands-off, empowering style that prioritizes both team success and individual growth. I break down projects into manageable subtasks and delegate them strategically—matching high-priority tasks to team members’ core strengths for efficiency, and assigning lower-priority tasks that stretch skills and foster learning. I remain accessible for guidance, cultivating a supportive and growth-oriented environment. This structured delegation nurtures a strong, versatile team that excels at meeting challenges while advancing professionally.
